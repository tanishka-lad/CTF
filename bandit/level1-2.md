# üü° Bandit Level 1 ‚Üí Level 2 ‚Äì Handling Special Filenames

### üìå Level Goal
> The password for the next level is stored in a file called `-` located in the home directory.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands Used

```bash
cd ~          # Navigate to home directory
ls -l         # List files with details
cat ./-       # Read the file named "-"
```

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **`cd ~`**  
   - Moves to the user's home directory (`/home/bandit1`).

2. **`ls -l`**  
   - Lists all files with metadata.  
   - Confirms the presence of a file literally named `-`.

3. **`cat ./-`**  
   - Reads the contents of the file named `-`.  
   - The `./` prefix tells the shell to treat `-` as a filename, not a command-line option.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why `cat -` Doesn‚Äôt Work

- `cat -` reads from **standard input**, not the file named `-`.
- Without `./`, the shell misinterprets the filename as an option.

Use this to log into **Bandit Level 2**:
```bash
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## üß† Reflection

This level teaches:
- How special characters in filenames can affect command behavior.
- The importance of **prefixing with `./`** to disambiguate filenames from options.
- A subtle but powerful lesson in shell parsing‚Äîcritical for adversarial analysis and CTFs.
