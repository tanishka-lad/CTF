 
## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge: Bandit Level 8 â†’ Level 9

### ðŸ“Œ Level Goal  
> The password for the next level is stored in the file `data.txt` and is the **only line of text that occurs only once**.

---

## ðŸ§­ Stepâ€‘byâ€‘Step Solution

### 1. Inspect the file
```bash
ls -a
```
- Lists all files in the current directory.  
- Confirms that `data.txt` exists.

```bash
cat data.txt
```
- Displays the contents of `data.txt`.  
- Youâ€™ll notice it contains a **huge list of repeated lines**.

---

### 2. Sort the file
```bash
sort data.txt
```
- `sort` arranges all lines in order.  
- This step is crucial because `uniq` only works on **adjacent duplicates**.  
- Sorting ensures identical lines are grouped together.

---

### 3. Filter unique lines
```bash
uniq -u
```
- `uniq` filters out repeated lines.  
- `-u` option prints only the lines that appear **once**.  
- When combined with `sort`, this isolates the password.

---

### 4. Combine with a pipeline
```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```
- `|` (pipe) sends the output of `sort` directly into `uniq`.  
- This oneâ€‘liner efficiently finds the single unique line in the file.  
- âœ… That line is the **password for the next level**.

## ðŸ”§ Commands Explained

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `sort`  | Orders lines alphabetically/numerically so duplicates are adjacent | `sort data.txt` |
| `uniq`  | Removes or filters adjacent duplicates | `uniq -u data.txt` |
| `uniq -u` | Shows only lines that occur once | `sort data.txt \| uniq -u` |
| `|` (pipe) | Redirects output of one command into another | `cmd1 \| cmd2` |
